        As a software engineer, I specialize in developing web applications
        using modern technologies such as React.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
        I have experience working on both front-end and back-end projects, and I
        am comfortable with the full software development life cycle from
        ideation to deployment.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In my current role, I am responsible for designing and implementing new
        features for our platform, as well as maintaining and improving existing
        functionality. I also enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams
        and contributing to code reviews to ensure that our software is of the
        highest quality.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Technologies</h3>
